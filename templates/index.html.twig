<h3>Welcome to the Guild Wars 2 Spidy website!</h3>
<p>This website aims to provide you with graphs of the sale and buy listings of items on the Guild Wars 2 Trade Market.
</p>
<p>Using this information we can get a better understanding of the economy in Guild Wars 2. <br />
It can also prevent you from getting caught in other players monopolizing the Trade Market with sudden spikes in prices.
</p>

<h3>You do <em>NOT</em> need to login to use this website!</h3>
<p>I'm using my own game account to gather the information and this website is only showing you what I've gathered over time.
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>ArenaNet has build the Trade Market so that it's loaded into the game from a website. <br />
You can also access this website with a browser and use your game account to login and view all the items and listings. <br />
<br />
Now what I've build is some tools which will run constantly to automatically login to that website and record all data we can find, <br />
as a result I can record the sale listings for all the items about every hour and with that data I can create graphs with the price changing over time!
</p>

<h3>Discussion / Questions / Feedback / Contribute</h3>
<p>The project is build in PHP 5.3 / HTML / CSS/ JS and is open source on <a href="https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy">github</a>. <br />
Everyone is free to setup the project for yourself (though atm without setup instructions it might be hard) <br >
and you're <em>very much</em> welcome to contribute pull requests and I'll do my best to merge them asap! <br />

<h3>Shut up, I just want to see the graphs!</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="/types">browse page</a> or use the <a href="/search">search</a> (both also located in the top bar) and enjoy ;)</p>

<h3 style="color: red;">IMPORTANT !!</h3>
<p>The data you're curently looking at is from the BWE #3 and the stress tests following that BWE. <br />
A lot of things (on my side and on the side of ArenaNet) has changed during that time, as a result some items have been duplicated, etc. <br />
<br />
On the early-game access launchday I will wipe the whole database and do my best to get everything running as soon as the game is online! <br />
However if there are any problems the best I can do it pop open my laptop to try and fix it while I continue playing, cause playing the game &gt; all!
